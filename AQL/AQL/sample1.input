Sun Yat-sen University, also known as Zhongshan University, is a public university in Guangdong, China. It was founded in 1924 by Sun Yat-sen, a revolutionary and the founding father of the Republic of China.

The school's main campus, commonly referred to as the South Campus, is located in Haizhu District, Guangzhou, inheriting the campus of the former Lingnan University. Three of its four campuses are also located in Guangzhou, including the new East Campus in the Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, and the medically oriented North Campus.[3] The school also has a new campus in Zhuhai, which is the largest among the four campuses.

Consistently ranked among the top 10 universities in China,[4][5]  University provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, technology, medical science, pharmacology and managerial science.

The university's assets include the world's fastest supercomputer Tianhe-2, which is valued at 2.4 billion yuan (US$390 million).[6] The university also has the largest affiliated hospital system in China.[7] The university's Zhuhai Campus owns the largest teaching building in Asia measuring by acreage.[8]

Two of the university's business education institutions, Sun Yat-sen Business School (SYSBS) and Lingnan (University) College are triple accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA. Only 3 business schools in mainland China hold this Triple accreditation.[9]

In 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded National Canton University and inscribed in his own handwriting the school motto of "Study Extensively, Enquire Accurately, Reflect Carefully, Discriminate Clearly, Practise Earnestly."[1][2] After the death of Sun Yat-sen, the national government that was set up during the first cooperation between the Communists and Nationalists formally decreed to change its name to Sun Yat-sen University on July 17, 1926. In 1926, there were five National Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) Universities: National First Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Guangzhou (the current Sun Yat-sen University), National Second Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Wuhan (the current Wuhan University, National Third Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Zhejiang (the current Zhejiang University), National Fourth Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Nanjing (the current Nanjing University, National Fifth Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Zhengzhou (the current Henan University). In the 1930s, there were seven schools in the university: the Schools of Arts, Sciences, Law, Engineering, Agricultural Studies, Medicine and Education. In 1935, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Sun Yat-sen University set up the first graduate schools in China and began to enroll graduate students. In the 1950s, colleges, schools and departments were readjusted nationwide, and Sun Yat-sen University became a comprehensive university with the liberal arts and sciences as its backbone disciplines.

In history, all the Sun Yat-sen Universities were the products of single-party state, based-on the political ideology with socialism characteristics.[10]
